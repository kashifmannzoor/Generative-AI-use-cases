### **Usecase: Urban Design Suggestions with Generative AI in Public Works Departments with LLMs**

#### Business Challenges:

Balancing diverse community preferences, environmental sustainability, and regulatory requirements is challenging.

Limited human resources and time for detailed design iterations.

Disparate datasets on demographics, environmental factors, and urban planning standards make it challenging to create unified designs.

Dependence on labor-intensive processes for creating and revising urban design proposals.

#### AI Solution Description:

> Contribute with suggestions for a solution approach to improve

Generative AI leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose tailored urban designs by integrating multiple data sources, such as community surveys, environmental studies, and regulatory guidelines. 

Here’s how it works:

Feed data on demographics, zoning laws, environmental factors, and community preferences into the LLM.

The LLM generates urban design proposals tailored to specific needs, such as housing layouts, public parks, and green spaces.

Urban planners can refine AI-generated designs by providing feedback, enabling the LLM to adapt and improve proposals for optimal outcomes.

#### Expected Impact/Business Outcome:

1. Revenue:
• Reduces costs associated with manual urban planning efforts. Attracts investment by showcasing advanced, efficient urban development solutions.

2. User Experience:
• Provides community-focused designs that align with local needs. Offers multiple design options quickly, enabling better decision-making.

3. Operations:
• Enhances efficiency in design iterations and stakeholder collaboration. Reduces turnaround time for proposals.

4. Process:
• Introduces streamlined workflows for urban planning. Facilitates better compliance with regulations through AI-generated guidance.

5. Cost:
• Cuts costs associated with extensive human labor and prolonged design cycles.


#### Required Data Sources:
Community Input: Surveys, feedback forms, and focus group data.

Regulatory Guidelines: Zoning laws, building codes, and planning regulations.

Environmental Data: Geographic, climate, and sustainability metrics.

Historical Urban Designs: Previous planning projects for learning patterns.

#### Strategic Fit and Impact Rating:

Strategic Fit: High

Strategic Fit: Highly aligns with the goals of modern urban planning departments focused on efficiency, sustainability, and community engagement.

Impact: High impact due to its ability to address complex urban challenges while enabling faster, data-driven decisions.

### **Usecase: Utilizing large language models (LLMs) for Simulating Urban Planning Scenarios (Urban Planning/Future of Cities), this use case derived from Deloitte**

#### Business Challenges:

Complexity of Urban Planning: Urban planning involves numerous variables, including demographics, infrastructure, environmental impact, and economic factors. Integrating these into a coherent plan is complex.
Time-Consuming Processes: Traditional urban planning methods are time-consuming and require extensive manual labor and iteration.
Resource Constraints: Limited access to real-time data and advanced tools can hinder effective planning and decision-making.
Public Participation: Ensuring community engagement and feedback in the planning process can be challenging.

#### AI Solution Description:
> [!CAUTION]
> Contribute with suggestions for a solution approach to improve

Using large language models (LLMs), generative AI can simulate urban planning scenarios by processing vast data and generating multiple design concepts.

Here’s how it can be done:

Data Integration: The AI model ingests various data sources, including demographic data, environmental reports, infrastructure details, and economic statistics.

Scenario Generation: The LLM processes this data to generate multiple urban planning scenarios. It can create detailed descriptions, visualizations, and potential outcomes for each scenario.

Simulation and Optimization: The generated scenarios are then simulated to predict their impacts. The AI model optimizes these scenarios based on predefined goals, such as sustainability, economic growth, and livability.

#### Expected Impact/Business Outcome:

Revenue: More efficient planning processes can lead to cost savings and better resource allocation, ultimately boosting economic development.
User Experience: Improved urban design and infrastructure enhance the quality of life for residents and increase public satisfaction.
Operations: Streamlined planning processes reduce the time and effort required for urban development projects.
Process: Automating data analysis and scenario generation speeds up the planning process and improves decision-making.
Cost: Reducing manual labor and errors in planning processes can significantly cut down costs.


#### Required Data Sources:
Environmental impact reports
Infrastructure data
Economic Statistics
Historical urban planning data
Public feedback and survey results

#### Strategic Fit and Impact Rating:

Implementing generative AI in urban planning aligns well with the strategic goals of modernizing infrastructure, improving public services, and fostering sustainable development. The high impact rating reflects its potential to transform urban planning processes, leading to more efficient and effective development outcomes.

Rating: High Impact & strategic fit
