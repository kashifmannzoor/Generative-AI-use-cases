### **Usecase: Urban Design Suggestions with Generative AI in Public Works Departments with LLMs**

#### Business Challenges:

Balancing diverse community preferences, environmental sustainability, and regulatory requirements is challenging.

Limited human resources and time for detailed design iterations.

Disparate datasets on demographics, environmental factors, and urban planning standards make it challenging to create unified designs.

Dependence on labor-intensive processes for creating and revising urban design proposals.

Generative AI leverages large language models (LLMs) to propose tailored urban designs by integrating multiple data sources, such as community surveys, environmental studies, and regulatory guidelines. 

Here’s how it works:

Feed data on demographics, zoning laws, environmental factors, and community preferences into the LLM.

The LLM generates urban design proposals tailored to specific needs, such as housing layouts, public parks, and green spaces.

Urban planners can refine AI-generated designs by providing feedback, enabling the LLM to adapt and improve proposals for optimal outcomes.

#### Expected Impact/Business Outcome:

1. Revenue:
• Reduces costs associated with manual urban planning efforts. Attracts investment by showcasing advanced, efficient urban development solutions.

2. User Experience:
• Provides community-focused designs that align with local needs. Offers multiple design options quickly, enabling better decision-making.

3. Operations:
• Enhances efficiency in design iterations and stakeholder collaboration. Reduces turnaround time for proposals.

4. Process:
• Introduces streamlined workflows for urban planning. Facilitates better compliance with regulations through AI-generated guidance.

5. Cost:
• Cuts costs associated with extensive human labor and prolonged design cycles.


#### Required Data Sources:
Community Input: Surveys, feedback forms, and focus group data.

Regulatory Guidelines: Zoning laws, building codes, and planning regulations.

Environmental Data: Geographic, climate, and sustainability metrics.

Historical Urban Designs: Previous planning projects for learning patterns.

#### Strategic Fit and Impact Rating:

Strategic Fit: High

Strategic Fit: Highly aligns with the goals of modern urban planning departments focused on efficiency, sustainability, and community engagement.

Impact: High impact due to its ability to address complex urban challenges while enabling faster, data-driven decisions.
