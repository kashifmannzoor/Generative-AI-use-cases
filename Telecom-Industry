> Contribute with suggestions for a solution approach to improve

Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist field technicians by simulating real-time network scenarios and guiding them through diagnostic processes. Using natural language processing, LLMs provide personalized, context-aware troubleshooting steps based on real-time data from the network. The LLM processes network logs, equipment details, and historical issue patterns to identify root causes and suggest optimal resolutions. Technicians can input questions or describe symptoms in natural language, and the LLM provides actionable insights and instructions in response. 
The LLM can be accessed via mobile devices, allowing technicians to get support directly in the field.
